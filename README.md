# Living-healthy-with-AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI can help people living busy lifestyle to choose diet and exercise based on their own preferences and history data. Namely, it is always difficult to choose a diet or type of sport/ exercise that fits with our preferences, why we often give up and return to unhealthy habits. 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This idea should solve 2 problems maing actually one solution at the end. Choice of diet as well as choice of exercise.
This problem is very frequent by people living busy life, havin a lot of tasks an dnot so much time to focus on analyzing their needs but also their possibilities and resources i order to succeed. That is why they often try some ways heard from someone else and very often this attempts of helthy eating is not successful because although this worked for someone else it can not work for themselves as their preferences or even limitations (allergies or similar) is preventing it.
Ma personal motivation is the fact that I am struggling with this for quite a while, have tried so many things, some worked, some didn't, but I always return to unhealthy lifestyle.
Although it can seem as vanity issue, it is more healthy issue as unhealthy lifestyle brings us to many diseases that could be avoided by paying more attention to basic things like eating properly and exercising enough.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
It would be used everyday, learning from data from user - his movements, habits like usually walking weekends, being awake late or staying up long in the evening, etc. It would need certain number of historic data in order to be able to predict well. Additionally some infomration can be fullfilled by user himself, however this data should be checked by habits in certain period (e.g. if I say that I usually eat vegetables and in next month I eat it only 2 days, algorithm can re-calculate the input).
The users wuld probably be adults between 20-50, mostly female, however it would be interesting probably to wider audience and I don't see a need of any restrictions.


## Data sources and AI methods

as explained above data would come partially by questionnaire fullfilled by user, however AI comes in on data given by habits (collected by smart watch or smartphone).
e.g. if you say that you own a dog - it is more likely that walking will be your prefered exercise, rather than if you own a bird.
I would collect data by a circle of people willing to participate in order to try and see if prediction by the AI are going in the right direction as well as what all can be used as source of data (e.g. what if a person doesn't own smartphone, only PC at home)?


## Challenges

I don't see any limitations, however the project doesn't solve motivation or measures level of success.
It can suggest, however it can not make sure it is followed.
additionally issue can be that wrong input can lead to dangerous suggestions, like a person by mistake inputs milk and next time system suggests milk as a part of a diet and a person is alergic on it.
On the other hand person can input wrong data, e.g. that he exerises every day and if habits don't show this, it will re-calibrate, however there is increase of possibility of mistake.


## What next?

I would need to separate both "problems" and line up all the inputs needed in order to get output as well as source of those.
After that I would need someone with programming skills or deeper knowledge of AI to help me with choosing right model for this and after that build a system.
There are some of the mobile applications already in use for similar actions - therefore it would be good for someone understanding background of these to help integrating that knowledge into this one.
